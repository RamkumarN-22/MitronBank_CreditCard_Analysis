DAX Measures in Mitron bank credit card Analysis

To find Total no of Customers---- Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(dim_customers[customer_id])

To find total no of male customers out of total customers----
Male = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(dim_customers),
    dim_customers[gender] = "Male"
)

To find total no of Female customers out of total customers----
Female = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(dim_customers),
    dim_customers[gender] = "Female"
)

Since the spend table has only 6 months of record I had created a measure to count the number of months for further calculation.
Month_Count = 
CALCULATE (
    DISTINCTCOUNT ( fact_spends[month] ),
    ALLEXCEPT ( fact_spends, fact_spends[customer_id] )
)

To find the Total income 
Total Income = 
SUMX(
    dim_customers,
    dim_customers[avg_income] * 6
)

To find total spend
Total Spent = 
SUM ( fact_spends[spend] 
)

To find avg of avg income
Average of Avg Income = 
AVERAGE ( dim_customers[avg_income] 
)

To find avg income utilizaton
Avg Income Utilisation % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Spent],
    [Total Income],
    0
)

**Project Description**

Mitron Bank planned to launch a new range of credit cards and needed a data-driven approach to understand customer preferences and design tailored offerings. The primary goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics, income utilization, and spending behaviors to uncover key segments that could drive adoption and profitability.

The business need was clear: identify high-value customer groups, understand where and how they spend, and align the new credit card features with those insights.

Using Power BI, I transformed raw customer and transaction data into an interactive dashboard that segmented customers by age, gender, occupation, city, and marital status. I explored spending categories (bills, groceries, electronics, etc.), analyzed average income utilization %, and compared behaviors across groups.

Through this analysis, I discovered **meaningful insights** such as:

The 25â€“34 age group and IT professionals showed the highest spending and utilization rates.

Mumbai customers had the strongest income-to-spending ratio (51.43%).

Bills, groceries, and electronics dominated customer spending categories.

I presented these insights visually through dashboards and provided strategic recommendations like tailored rewards programs, flexible payment options, and enhanced digital features. These actions positioned Mitron Bank to boost credit card adoption, improve customer engagement, and maximize revenue growth.
